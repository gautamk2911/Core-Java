**3. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION**

### A. PURPOSE

The Smart UV-C Door Handle is an intelligent, self-disinfecting handle designed to eliminate surface pathogens and reduce the transmission of infectious diseases in high-contact environments. Leveraging the germicidal properties of UV-C light, the handle autonomously sanitizes itself between uses, making it ideal for hospitals, offices, schools, malls, and public transport stations.

This invention responds to the growing demand for self-sustaining hygiene technology in a post-pandemic world where surface-based viral and bacterial transmission remains a threat.

---

### B. PROBLEM ADDRESSED BY THE INVENTION

###



Door handles are one of the most touched surfaces in public and private spaces. Despite regular cleaning, these surfaces quickly become breeding grounds for bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Manual cleaning is not only inconsistent but also labor-intensive and unsustainable.



This invention solves the problem by embedding a UV-C disinfection system within the door handle that automatically activates when the handle is not in use. This ensures constant sanitation without human intervention. The design also includes safety mechanisms to prevent UV exposure during human contact, making it both practical and safe.



### C. OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION

1. To develop an autonomous and safe sterilization mechanism using UV-C light embedded in door handles.
2. To reduce human dependency in sanitization and improve surface hygiene standards in high-traffic areas.
3. To build a scalable and energy-efficient solution that can retrofit onto existing infrastructure.
4. To integrate motion sensing and smart energy management systems for optimized performance and safety.

### E. DETAILED DESCRIPTION

The handle integrates a modular, cylindrical casing with:

- **UV-C LEDs (254 nm):** Aligned inside the handle to irradiate the external surface.
- **Smart IR/Motion Sensors:** Detect user approach and deactivate UV light during usage.
- **Sterilization Timer:** Activates UV-C pulses between uses.
- **Battery/Solar/Wired Power Supply:** Options for different installations.
- **Heat Sink and Protective Coating:** Ensures durability and safety.
- **Indicator LEDs:** Show sanitation status (Idle, Active, Error).

The housing is built from a UV-transmissible, shatterproof material like quartz-infused polycarbonate. The sterilization cycle is triggered after 10 seconds of inactivity and lasts 8–15 seconds depending on environmental conditions.

---

### F. RESULTS AND ADVANTAGES

- **Pathogen Elimination:** Capable of destroying 99.9% of bacteria and viruses on contact surfaces.
- **Automated Hygiene:** Reduces need for manual sanitization.
- **User-Safe:** Sensors prevent accidental UV exposure.
- **Energy Efficient:** Minimal power consumption through smart scheduling.
- **Scalable:** Can be applied to public doors, elevators, hospital wards, restrooms, and more.
